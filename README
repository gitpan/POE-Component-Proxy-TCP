POE-Component-Proxy-TCP version 0.01
====================================

--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Proxy::TCP is an asynchronous, event driven proxy POE
component.  It accepts tcp connection on a specified well-know port
from a remote client, and then connects to a remote server at a specified host
and port. After connection it copies all data received from either side to the other,
calling given callbacks to perform any application specific processing.

------------
Requirements
------------

POE::Component::Proxy::TCP requires POE.  Some example programs
require Tk.pm. The requirements are encoded in Makefile.PL, so the
CPAN shell should do the right thing.  If this is installed without
the CPAN shell, the person installing it will have to do the right
thing manually.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------
[NOT YET! Will not be in CPAN until in sourceforge first - AVP]

POE::Component::Proxy::TCP may be installed through the CPAN shell
in the usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::Proxy::TCP'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::Proxy::TCP

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::Proxy::TCP

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE::Component::Proxy::TCP can also be installed manually.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.
